# Remove-Duplicates-from-Text-File
This Python program reads a text file, removes duplicate lines, and saves the cleaned content to a new file. It also provides a summary of how many duplicates were found and how many unique lines were kept. The unique lines are sorted in ascending order before being saved to the new file.
